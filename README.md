node-squares
=====================

Moving squares on HTML5 canvas with Node.js on the serverside

### Installing the app

This application uses [Node](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](http://npmjs.org/) for server-side depedencies handling and [Bower](http://bower.io/) for client-side dependencies. Just run from the cloned app folder:

```
npm install
```

It will install Bower and all needed dependencies locally. After that, you can run the app:

```
node app.js
```

Head to `localhost:8000` to see the app working.

### Controls

* `Left mouse button` moves the square under cursor.
* `Right mouse button` adds the new square on a random position. If there is a square under the cursor already, changes it's color.
